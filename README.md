# stepmaina-batocera
- stepmaina port for batocera 40 on a rpi5 .
- this build contains a copy of stepmania 5.1 and has all the libs and a .sh to run it in batocera.
- you extract the stepmania zip to /userdata/roms/ports/stepmania and you shold see a folder called stepmania containng a bunch of folders and a executable with some libs.
 - you shold also have the script `stepmania.sh` in the ports folder too.
  - and if it was placed correctly
    - it should hopefully run without issues
