# stepmaina-batocera
 stepmaina port for batocera 40 on a rpi5
 this build contains a copy of stepmania 5.1 and has all the libs and a .sh to run it in batocera
 you add the stepmaina folder to /userdata/roms/ports/ and have the script in the ports folder too
 then it should hopefully run without issues
